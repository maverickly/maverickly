## Prabhat Kumar
Prabhat Kumar, quickly developed a passion for open source software. Now, he gets to work on open source projects at his day time job, which includes maintaining — Maverickly Operations (M°ops).

## Backstory
I first started poking around "maverickly" in August 2018. Writing backend in Node was something I had done in the past few years, and I always love new technology and exciting communities. It was a natural fit, and as soon as I found something I could help out with, the commits just started flowing!

I started writing the efficient code, checking pull requests and issues regularly. My goal was to provide valuable input, real suggestions, and help out in any way I could. I first started looking at M°ops while on the Infrastructure team at my ignited job. I searched a lot to get some "codenauts" and helped them out to get foots into the door in the "maverickly" community. I can’t thank those guys enough, I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for them. I was able to gain inventor and maintainer status after a few months of working on M°ops.
