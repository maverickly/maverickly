## Prabhat Kumar
Prabhat Kumar, quickly developed a passion for open source software. Now, he gets to work on open source projects at his day time job, which includes maintaining — Maverickly Operations (M°ops).

## Backstory
I first started poking around "maverickly" in August 2018. Writing backend in Node was something I had done in the past few years, and I always love new technology and exciting communities. It was a natural fit, and as soon as I found something I could help out with, the commits just started flowing!
